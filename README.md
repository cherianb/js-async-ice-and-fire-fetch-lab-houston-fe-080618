     # JavaScript `fetch()` Lab

## Problem Statement

In this lab, we'll be using `fetch()` to send web requests to
the [Game of Thrones][GoT] API. We'll make a web request to the API, and in
return we will receive a collection of data, structured like a nested hash.

#### What's an API?

An **API**, or application programming interface, is a manner in which companies
and organizations, like Twitter or the New York City government, or the super
fans behind the Game of Thrones API, expose their data and/or functionality to
the public (i.e. talented programmers like yourself) for use. APIs allow us to
add important data and functionality to the applications we build. You can think
of an API as one way in which data is exposed to us developers for use in our
own programs.

Just like we can use JavaScript to send a web request for a web page that is
written in HTML, and receive a response that is full of HTML, we can use
JavaScript to send a web request to an API and receive a collection of JSON in
return.

#### What's JSON?

**JSON** is a language-agnostic way of formatting data. If we send a web request
to the Game of Thrones API, it will return to us a JSON collection of data. With
just one easy line of code, we can tell JavaScript to treat that JSON collection
as a nested hash. In this way, large and complicated amounts of data can be
shared across platforms.

## Objective

* Use `fetch()` to programmatically make a web request

## Instructions

Getting data from the [Game of Thrones][GoT] API with `fetch()` is a pretty easy
process, as we've seen. If we're just trying to `GET` some JSON, we can add the
following code to our JavaScript console in the browser:

```js
fetch('https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books')
  .then(resp => resp.json())
  .then(json => console.log(json));
```

Remember that we can use the `json` method of the `Body` mixin to render our
response as JSON, and that each `then` passes its return value to the next
`then` as an argument.

Our response from the API contains all ten books currently existing in the Game
of Thrones series, in a JSON format.

In this case, since we've logged it to the console, the console is interpreting
that format for us into a nicely formatted way that we can read. Since we asked
for all the books with the `/books` part of the url, it gave us all the books.
APIs have many different variations and can be as customizable as the developer
wants them to be. If you're really lucky, there will be robust documentation to
go along with the API to help you out and give you a road map to help you figure
out how to format your request for information. For now we'll focus on just
getting different kinds of information out of the API.

You will need to find in the browser console:

1. All the Houses in Game of Thrones
2. The 5th book in the series
3. The 1031st character in the series

## Deliverables

In `index.js`, there is an empty function, `fetchBooks()`, that is called when
`index.html` is loaded. To pass this lab, this function should include a fetch
request to the Game of Thrones API ('https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books').
The returned response should be converted to JSON. Call the second function,
`renderBooks()`, passing in the API's returned JSON data as the argument.

## Conclusion

APIs are powerful tools that can help you leverage the power of the available
data on the web. Once you feel comfortable using the tools that access the data,
the world is your oyster!
